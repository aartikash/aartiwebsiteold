  <article class="post-content">
    <p>These summer vacations, the usual time for first year masters students to be doing some form of internships, I was busy exploring a few different aspects of the academic life. I decided to visit my friend in Montreal during these vacations. My reasons were strictly - ‘to chill’. A little background, in my previous term, I decided to take three seminar-style courses along with TA and my research work. Hence, a break became an absolute necessity. Since, I was anyway going to enjoy Montreal for a while, I decided to match my dates with the ICSE’19 dates.</p>

<p>ICSE’19 - This was my first conference which I attended after my first year at graduate school. I was not quite sure if it is much relevant to what I am trying to achieve. However, overall it was an interesting and different experience. I attended a student mentoring workshop and a few talks. In the end I realized that the best part about attending the conference was it’s food. Another realization was it’s not a good practice to attend a conference where we don’t have any submission or some specific agenda/work (eg. Student volunteering, specific workshops we want to attend etc.)</p>

<p>CS-CAN Student Symposium 19 - This was a slightly more fun experience than ICSE’19 for me personally. Maybe because I had a poster presentation there. However, there was a short workshop by a PhD student on reproducibility of code which was very helpful for me. As a new researcher it’s initially difficult to grasp the fact that some work might not be as they claim it is. But, sadly that is true. Most of the times papers are nowhere close to the code which is available on GitHub. This makes a new researcher waste a lot of time, since, we want to build up on pre-existing work.</p>

<p>Overall, apart from enjoying my time at Montreal and it’s food, I had a pretty fun time experiencing  the academic life.</p>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>When I started my research, I never thought that I will end up finding Cyber-Physical-Systems so fascinating.</p>

<p>CPS are systems which combine the cyber capabilities with the physical capabilities which neither part could solve again. The cyber aspect of the system can be similar distributed systems or operating systems. However, the catch here is that apart from the systems which we are familiar with there is a physics and perhaps a biology aspect of things involved which also have a control on these systems.</p>

<p>The most common and useful examples of CPS are autonomous vehicles. Tesla has made it huge. However, another aspect is the Health modelled systems. Imagine a scenario where a doctor from Tokyo is able to perform a surgery on a patient sitting on the surgery table in Cleveland(Don’t ask me why I chose Cleveland for this example). The only requirement would be a surgical robot in the patient’s room with the doctor controlling it from Tokyo. Yeah, that is cool. Now, imagine a different scenario, where, the robot has learnt from the previous surgeries from the doctor controlling it, and now is able to partially do the standard parts of the operation without any intervention and hence the doctor’s assistant sits and keeps a check on the robot performing the surgery and ensuring it is not screwing up. Hmm, that is also pretty cool. I will leave a few other scenarios and go to the best possible scenario now. Imagine, now it’s 2050 and the patient is delivering a very important business presentation and the robot is silently performing the surgery! (haha, Woah!)</p>

<p>If we ever reach the final scenario, will it not be super awesome?</p>

<p>Based on the scenarios, one question to ask oneself would be? Which domain does CPS not offer you to do “great” research. Well, let me list it out:</p>

<p>One note: These fields might be a subset of each other (for eg. ML is for AI, but I will list them separately anyway)</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence - The surgical robot takes decisions on it’s own. (yey)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Machine Learning - The surgical robot takes decisions on it’s own and learns on it’s own too. (yey)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Programming Languages - Develop secure and error-free PLs for such systems. (yey)</p>
  </li>
  <li>Security</li>
  <li>Embedded Systems</li>
  <li>Operating systems, Distributed Systems</li>
  <li>Software Engineering</li>
  <li>Verification (My personal fav, will probably talk more about it soon.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Plus, it’s one area where if you have an entrepreneurial spirit, it’s got potential. :D</p>

<p>Hence, working in this area can be really fun. It can probably lead to a new area of research being developed which the current areas are incapable of providing.</p>

<p>To wrap it up, working in this domain, gives a person like me who loves every area in this field to explore and learn more and more and more. (YEY!)
Oh and also, it’s going to be really impactful for the society.</p>

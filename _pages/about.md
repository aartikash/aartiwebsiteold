<!-- I love playing guitar and swimming. It's been more than a decade since I picked up this instrument and since then I have never looked back. My most precious possession is my ['93 Japanese vintage stratocaster]({{ site.url }}assets/img/guitar.jpg). I keep putting short videos now and then. I recently started painting (Beware!). I read a lot, my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50819981-aarti-kashyap) profile tracks some of the works I read. -->
